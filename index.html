    <!-- Chosen Palette: Cosmic Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tabbed, single-page dashboard architecture was chosen to deconstruct the dense report into manageable, thematic sections. The user flow is non-linear, starting with a high-level "Overview" and allowing deep dives into "Planets," "Life Areas," "Timeline," "Charts," and a new "3D Orrery" for interactive visualization. This structure prioritizes user-driven exploration over passive reading. Key interactions include clicking on planets and life area cards to dynamically display detailed information, a radar chart for a quick visual summary of planetary strengths, and a drag-to-rotate 3D sphere. This approach makes the complex astrological data more accessible and engaging. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Core birth details & astrological signs -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Styled cards -> Interaction: Static Display -> Justification: Quick, at-a-glance information for immediate context. Method: HTML/Tailwind.
        - Report Info: Planetary positions and dignities -> Goal: Explore/Compare -> Viz: Radar Chart & Interactive Grid -> Interaction: Click on planet icon to reveal detailed text -> Justification: The radar chart provides a novel quantitative summary, while the interactive grid allows focused study of each planet's influence without clutter. Library: Chart.js for radar, JS/HTML for grid.
        - Report Info: House-by-house analysis (Bhavas) -> Goal: Organize/Explore -> Viz: Grid of 12 cards -> Interaction: Click card to show detailed analysis -> Justification: Breaks down the largest portion of the report's text into logical, user-selectable segments, preventing information overload. Method: JS/HTML/Tailwind.
        - Report Info: Dasha periods -> Goal: Understand Change/Time -> Viz: Horizontal timeline -> Interaction: Static display with clear labeling -> Justification: Visually represents the long-term planetary influences and their durations effectively. Method: HTML/Tailwind.
        - Report Info: North/South Indian Chart Diagrams -> Goal: Visualize -> Viz: Styled HTML Tables -> Interaction: Static display -> Justification: Replicates the traditional and essential astrological chart layouts with precision and clarity using web-standard elements. Method: HTML/Tailwind.
        - Report Info: Cosmic energies / Abstract representation -> Goal: Engage/Visualize -> Viz: 3D Interactive Sphere -> Interaction: Mouse/Touch drag to rotate -> Justification: Adds a dynamic and visually appealing element to symbolize the celestial influences, enhancing user engagement and offering a unique interactive experience. Library: three.js.

Its placement in the 10th house indicates a strong drive for career success, leadership, and public recognition. It suggests an intense, strategic, and transformative professional approach, with an ability to manage complex situations and bring hidden truths to light. This can lead to a powerful public image and fame. It is a primary significator of your father, indicating he is likely an influential and successful figure whose achievements have shaped your aspirations. While this relationship is a source of strength, it might also involve complex dynamics, potentially including emotional distance or control. You have a potential for workaholism, and there is a risk of arrogance or ego issues.' },
                moon: { title: '🌙 Moon in Pisces (2nd House)', text: 'Represents mother, mind, and emotions. In Pisces, it creates a deeply compassionate, intuitive, and sensitive nature. You absorb the emotions of others, acting as an empath. This placement in the 2nd house links emotional well-being to financial security and family values. Your speech is often soft and nurturing. This can also lead to emotional turmoil and extreme shifts in mood, as you are hypersensitive to the emotions and energies around you. There\'s a duality between your intellectual detachment (Aquarius Ascendant) and this profound emotional sensitivity (Pisces Moon), leading to a complex inner emotional world.' },
                mars: { title: '♂️ Mars in Aries (3rd House, Retrograde)', text: 'Represents energy, courage, and siblings. In its own sign of Aries, it provides immense courage, determination, and a direct communication style. It fuels a love for short travels and learning new skills, and you approach education with a competitive spirit. The retrograde status suggests that this assertive energy may be internalized or expressed in unconventional ways, requiring conscious management to avoid conflict. This placement also indicates a dynamic but potentially contentious relationship with siblings, with a tendency towards possessiveness in relationships, which can create friction.' },
                mercury: { title: '☿️ Mercury in Scorpio (10th House)', text: 'Represents intellect, communication, and skills. In Scorpio in the 10th house, it creates a deeply analytical, investigative, and strategic mind, perfect for research and fields like data science. It grants persistence in intellectual pursuits and an ability to uncover hidden information, driving career success. This placement is favorable for writing and journalism, especially exploring mystical or dark themes. You are inherently intelligent and capable of deep understanding without relying solely on formal education. You have the potential for multiple income sources and are a good negotiator and businessperson. However, you might find it difficult to work in groups unless you are in a leadership position, as you crave authority and may impose your views, potentially leading to interpersonal conflicts. This also suggests potential for quick success, appreciation, and sudden fame.' },
                jupiter: { title: '♃ Jupiter in Libra (9th House)', text: 'Represents wisdom, fortune, and higher learning.

You are open-minded and likely to undertake long-distance travel for education or spiritual growth, expanding your knowledge and cultural horizons. You possess a strong spiritual inclination, with potential to become a spiritual leader or mentor.

It may lead to high, sometimes unrealistic, expectations in romance and a fascination with foreign lands or hidden pleasures. It favors prosperity through foreign connections and suggests an appreciation for visiting unfamiliar terrains. This placement also leads to a more private or restrained expression of love and a need to manage unrealistic expectations in relationships to find true fulfillment. There can be high, potentially unrealistic sexual expectations, which could lead to dissatisfaction or a tendency towards flirtatiousness and multiple relationships if reality does not match fantasy. It also highly favors business partnerships and joint ventures, indicating increased chances of success and prosperity, but can lead to higher expenditures than income.' },

In the 6th house, it gives the discipline to overcome enemies and obstacles through hard work. However, in the enemy sign of Cancer and retrograde, it indicates that progress in life and career may be slow, marked by hurdles, emotional stress, and potential chronic health issues, particularly digestive problems and stomach ailments. It is the great teacher of patience and perseverance. This placement also means you will be determined to conquer your enemies through hard work and have excellent management control over subordinates. However, you might be perceived as selfish or cunning, potentially creating hidden enemies or opposition. This intensified Saturnine influence is critical for foundational work, demanding a highly structured and patient approach, reinforcing themes of discipline and karmic lessons throughout your life.' },

In the 2nd house, it can create an unconventional approach to earning wealth and a fluctuating financial status. It fuels a strong interest in spirituality, mysticism, and transcendental knowledge, but can also cause conflicts over income or family resources.

You place significant value on property and have a natural disposition for real estate gains. You likely share a strong bond with your mother, who may be soft-spoken and nurturing. However, Saturn\'s retrograde aspect in Cancer (inimical to Moon, 4th house lord) can indicate potential "troubles with mother," health challenges for her, or emotional distance in the relationship, with property gains possibly experiencing delays.' },
